Transaction data from queries (SQL- already written by Roy ) against the Service into a reporting server (right now is Silverback).  This same query provides the CSV for the client.  FTP it to Silverback Server and database.  

Kristy / Leonardo,

We are getting started on the operational reports application.  First up is a report from LA.  Could we get a login with readonly access to the DEV LA database setup for this?  Martel and Alex will be doing some analysis. 

Could we post login information on confluence?

Thanks
Chris

Hi,

There are different reports extracted from LA.
What specific report(s) is the ask here?
